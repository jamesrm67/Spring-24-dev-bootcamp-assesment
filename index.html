        <P id="center">This semester I'm the philanthropy chairman for my fraternity. After being involved with volunteering opportunities in high school, Iâ€™m really excited to share that part of my life with so many of my friends and to get them involved with it. With so many young people, I feel like we can really be of a lot of help in just one semester. Along with that, an alumnus contacted me about a fundraiser he is organizing for poor and working people in Shigar Valley, Pakistan. Check out my philanthropic involvements below!</P>
